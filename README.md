# Storage Deployment Optimization Model (SDOM) üîã
SDOM is an NREL open-source high-resolution grid planning framework designed to optimize the deployment and operation of energy storage technologies across diverse temporal and spatial scales. It is particularly suited for evaluating long-duration and seasonal storage applications, as well as the complementarity among variable renewable energy (VRE) sources.

# Key Features
‚öôÔ∏è
- **Temporal Resolution:** Hourly simulations over a full year enable precise modeling of storage dynamics and renewable generation variability.

- **Spatial Resolution:** Fine-grained representation of VRE sources (e.g., solar, wind) captures geographic diversity and enhances system fidelity.

- **Copper Plate Modeling:** SDOM Model neglects transmission constraints to keep the model tractable from the computational standpoint. Future SDOM releases should include inter-regional transmission constraints.

- **Fixed Generation Profiles:** Nuclear, hydropower, and other non-variable renewables (e.g., biomass, geothermal) are treated as fixed inputs using year-long time series data.

- **System Optimization Objective:** Minimizes total system cost‚Äîincluding capital, fixed/variable O&M, and fuel costs‚Äîwhile satisfying user-defined carbon-free or renewable energy targets.

- **Modeling approach:** Formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to allow rigorous optimization of discrete investment and operational decisions.

- **Platforms:** 
  - SDOM was originally developed in GAMS (https://github.com/NREL/SDOM). 
  
  - In order offer a full open-source solution also was developed this python package. This version will be released soon and it requires python 3.10+.

- **Solver Compatibility:** Currently the SDOM python version is only compatible with [open-source CBC solver](https://www.coin-or.org/Cbc/cbcuserguide.html). In this repo the [windows executable for cbc](./cbc.exe) is provided. You will need to provide the path of cbc solver to run SDOM as illustrated in our [script demonstration](#sdom-example-(demonstration-script))

## Optimization Scope
üìâ
SDOM performs cost minimization across a 1-year operation window using a copper plate assumption‚Äîi.e., no internal transmission constraints‚Äîmaking it computationally efficient while capturing major cost drivers. Conventional generators are used as balancing resources, and storage technologies serve to meet carbon or renewable penetration goals.

## Notes on Model Expansion
While SDOM currently supports a 1-year horizon, multiyear analyses could provide deeper insights into how interannual variability affects storage needs. Chronological, simulation-based approaches are better suited for this but present significant computational challenges‚Äîespecially at hourly resolution. Extending SDOM to support multiyear optimization is left as future work.
